    <h2>1.Projects of NASA:-</h2>
    <p>(1) APOLLO - NASA's best space science mission? The one humans got along on, of course! Not only was sending a man to the moon monumental for human history, but the Apollo trips were the first to bring celestial stuffback to Earth and greatly advanced our scientific understanding of the moon.Before Apollo, many people weren't evenconvinced the moon wasn't made out of cheese (well? non-scientists at least).By studying the moon up close and personal, and then carting? loads of moonrocks home, the Apollo astronauts gathered data that helped us learn how oldthe moon is, what it's made out of, and even how it might have begun.</p>
    <p>(2) HUBBLE - The most-loved of all NASA spacecraft, the Hubble SpaceTelescope has name recognition around the world. Its photos have changed theway everyday people figure themselves into the cosmos. The observatory has alsoradically changedscience, making breakthroughs on astronomical issues too numerous to count.By finally sending up an optical telescope to peer at the sky from beyondEarth's turbulent atmosphere, NASA developed a tool that could reveal stars,planets, nebulae and galaxies in all their fully-detailed glory.
    <br>
    <p>(3) VOYAGER - Shortly after the Pioneers made their flybys, the Voyager1 and Voyager 2 probes followed. They made many important discoveries aboutJupiter and Saturn, including rings around Jupiter and the presence ofvolcanism on Jupiter's moon, Io. Voyager went on to make the first flybys ofUranus, where it discovered 10 new moons, and Neptune, where it found thatNeptune actually weighs less than astronomers thought. Both Voyager crafts haveenough power to keep transmitting radio signals until at least 2025, and arenow exploring the very edgeof the solar system and beginning of interstellar space. Voyager 2 iscurrently the farthest man-made object from Earth, at more than a hundred timesthe distance from the Earth to the sun, and more than twice as far as Pluto.</p>  
    <br>  

    <h2>2.Projects of ROSCOMOS:-</h2>
    <p>(1) First Manned Mission - The former Soviet Union maintained its lead by launching the first human into orbit on April 12, 1961 with cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin making history aboard his Vostok spacecraft. Future Soviet firsts, including the first woman in space and the first-ever spacewalk, followed in later years.
    <br>
    <p>(2) Space Station Firsts - The Soviet Union kicked off the era of manned space stations with its Salyut series of orbital outposts. Salyut 1 launched on April 19, 1971. After a beleaguered start, which included the death of the second Salyut 1 crew and failed follow-up Salyut launches, the Salyut 6 and 7 stations became the first operational stations and led to the development of the Mir Space Station. NASA</p>
    <p>(3) A Soviet Space Shuttle - Russian for 'Snowstorm,' the former Soviet Union's space shuttle Buran made only one unmanned spaceflight in November 1988 before the program was shelved and its orbiters put in storage. Unlike NASA's space shuttle fleet, the Buran orbiter could be flown on automated missions. It was launched with the aid of the massive Energia booster.</p>
    <br>

    <h2>3.Projects of CNSA:-</h2>
    <p>(1) Fengyun (FY) Meteorological Satellites - The Fengyun meteorological satellites are an important space infrastructure in China. After more than 50 years of development, China became one of the few countries and regions in the world that has both polar-orbiting and geostationary meteorological satellites. The Fengyun meteorological satellites have provided satellite data and product services for 120 countries and regions around the world.</p>
    <p>(2) Space Laboratory Missions - The mission phase of the Space Laboratory consists of four missions, including the maiden launch of the Long March 7, as well as missions of the space lab Tiangong-2, manned spacecraft Shenzhou-11 and cargo spacecraft Tianzhou-1.In June 2016, the first Long March 7, China’s new-generation medium-lift launch vehicle, successfully took off from Wenchang Space Launch Center, greatly improving China’s capability of access to space and laying a solid foundation for follow-on missions.</p>
    <p>(3) Launch Vehicles - The Long March (LM) launch vehicles developed by CASC have made over 290 flights, and are capable of sending spacecraft into LEO, SSO, GTO and Earth-Moon transfer trajectory. They have reached the world advanced level in reliability, safety and orbit injection accuracy. In recent years, the new-generation launch vehicles, including LM-5, LM-6, LM-7 and LM-11, have made their maiden flights successfully, greatly increasing China’s ability to access space. LM-5 has an LEO payload capacity of 25000 kg and a GTO payload capacity of 14000 kg.</p>

    <h2>4.Projects of ISRO:-</h2>
    <p>(1) Aryabhata, 1975 - Named after the legendary Indian astronomer, Aryabhata, the Aryabhata satellite was the first Indian satellite. It was completely manufactured, designed, and assembled in India. Weighing over 360 kg, the satellite was launched on April 19, 1975, by a Soviet Kosmos-3M rocket, from Volgograd Launch Station in Russia. It paved the way for other successful missions to come.</p>
    <p>(2) Chandrayaan-1, 2008 - It was India’s first mission to the Moon. Launched successfully on October 22, 2008, the mission turned out to be one of the biggest scientific breakthroughs as the craft detected the presence of water molecules on the lunar surface. It was through Chandrayaan-1 that the world got to know about water on the Moon. </p>
    <p>(3) Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM), 2014 -  With the Mars Orbiter Mission, popularly known as MOM, India became the first nation to reach the red planet Mars on its first try. It was also the nation’s first interplanetary mission. Mangalyaan was launched on November 5, 2013, by the PSLV-C25 rocket, from Sriharikota. With this, ISRO became the fourth space agency to successfully launch a spacecraft into orbit around Mars. Despite having a mission duration of 6 months, MOM has been in orbit for 7 years as of September 24, 2021.</p>
    <br>

    <h2>5.Projects of European Space Agency (ESA):-</h2>
    <p>(1) Copernicus Programme -  Copernicus is the Earth observation component of the European Union Space Programme, managed by the European Commission and implemented in partnership with the EU Member States, the European Space Agency (ESA), the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT), the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), the Joint Research Centre (JRC), the European Environment Agency (EEA), the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA), Frontex, SatCen and Mercator Océan.</p>
    <p>(2) ExoMars - The goals of ExoMars are to search for signs of past life on Mars, investigate how the Martian water and geochemical environment varies, investigate atmospheric trace gases and their sources and, by doing so, demonstrate the technologies for a future Mars sample-return mission.</p>
    <p>(3) Living Planet Programme -  The Living Planet Programme (LPP) ,is a programme within the European Space Agency which is managed by the Earth Observation Programmes Directorate. LPP consists of two classes of Earth observation missions (listed below) including research missions known as Earth Explorers, and the Earth Watch class of missions whose objective is to develop support operational applications such as numerical weather forecasting or resource management.</p>
    <br>

    <h2>6.Projects of Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA):-</h2>
    <p>(1) X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM) - The X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM, pronounced "crism"), formerly the X-ray Astronomy Recovery Mission (XARM), is an X-ray astronomy satellite of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) to provide breakthroughs in the study of structure formation of the universe, outflows from galaxy nuclei, and dark matter.</p>
    <p>(2) Smart Lander for Investigating Moon (SLIM) -  The Smart Lander for Investigating Moon (SLIM) is a Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) mission designed to demonstrate accurate lunar landing techniques by a small explorer, with the objective of acceleration of the study of the Moon and planets using lighter exploration systems.</p>
    <p>(3) Lunar Polar Exploration Mission(LUPEX) -  The main objective of the LUPEX Mission is water prospecting and analysis. For this, the mission will demonstrate new surface exploration technologies related to vehicular transport and lunar night survival. In addition, the mission aims for sustainable exploration in the polar region of the moon.</p>
