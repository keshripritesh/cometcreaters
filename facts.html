          <h1>Facts</h1>
          <h2 style="color: blueviolet; size: 20px;">The interesting facts are!</h2>
          <h1 style="color: rgba(16, 16, 18, 0.861);"> 1. Neutron stars can spin at a rate of 600 rotations per second</h1>"
          <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/PIA18848-PSRB1509-58-ChandraXRay-WiseIR-20141023.jpg/310px-PIA18848-PSRB1509-58-ChandraXRay-WiseIR-20141023.jpg" alt="images" >
          <p style="color:  #a40f0fdc;"> <br>Neutron stars are one of the possible evolutionary end-points of high mass stars. <br> They're born in a core-collapse supernova star explosion and subsequently rotate extremely rapidly as a consequence of their physics. <br> Neutron stars can rotate up to 60 times per second after born. <br> Under special circumstances, this rate can increase to more than 600 times per second.</p>
          <h1 style="color: rgba(16, 16, 18, 0.861);"> 2. Space is completely silent</h1>
          <img src="https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/077B65B4-9936-4C58-B1F856F562F98259_source.jpg?w=590&h=800&D2E1EE66-516E-4C56-A2CE448689E28FD2" alt="images">
          <p style="color: #a40f0fdc;"> <br> Sound waves need a medium to travel through.<br> Since there is no atmosphere in the vacuum of space, the realm between stars will always be eerily silent.</p>
          <h1 style="color: rgba(16, 16, 18, 0.861);"> 3. There is an uncountable number of stars in the known universe</h1>
          <img src="https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cms/cpg15x/albums/userpics/dwarfgalaxy1.jpg" alt="images">
          <p  style="color:  #a40f0fdc;"> <br> We basically have no idea how many stars there are in the universe. <br> Right now we use our estimate of how many stars there are in our own galaxy, the Milky Way. We then multiply that number by the best guesstimate of the number of galaxies in the universe. <br> After all that math, NASA can only confidently say that say there all zillions of uncountable stars. A zillion is any uncountable amount.</p>
          <h1 style="color: rgba(16, 16, 18, 0.861);"> 4. The Apollo astronauts' footprints on the moon will probably stay there for at least 100 million years</h1>
          <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Apollo_17_Command_Module_AS17-145-22261HR.jpg/270px-Apollo_17_Command_Module_AS17-145-22261HR.jpg" alt="images">
          <p style="color: #a40f0fdc;"> <br> Since the moon doesn't have an atmosphere, there's no wind or water to erode or wash away the Apollo astronauts' mark on the moon. <br> That means their footprints, roverprints, spaceship prints, and discarded materials will stay preserved on the moon for a very long time.</p>
          <h1 style="color: rgba(16, 16, 18, 0.861);"> 5. 99 percent of our solar system's mass is the sun</h1>
          <img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1095/2016/11/03160106/OSC_Astro_15_01_Comparison.jpg" alt="images">
          <p style="color: #a40f0fdc;"> <br> Our star, the sun, is so dense that it accounts for a whopping 99 percent of the mass of our entire solar system.<br> That's what allows it to dominate all of the planets gravitationally.<br>

              Technically, our sun is a "G-type main-sequence star" which means that every second, it fuses approximately 600 million tons of hydrogen to helium.<br> It also converts about 4 million tons of matter to energy as a byproduct.
              
              When the sun dies, it will become a red giant and envelop the Earth and everything on it. But don't worry: That won't happen for another 5 billion years.</p>
          
          <h1 style="color: rgba(16, 16, 18, 0.861);"> 6. More energy from the sun hits Earth every hour than the planet uses in a year</h1>
          <img src="https://discovery.sndimg.com/content/dam/images/discovery/fullset/2022/5/13/Solar_Orbiter.jpg.rend.hgtvcom.406.406.suffix/1652481111246.jpeg" alt="images">
          <p style="color: #a40f0fdc;"> <br> The use of solar energy has increased at a rate of 20 percent each year for the past 15 years.<br> According to Yale Environment 360, the world added 30 percent more solar energy capacity in 2017, meaning that 98.9 gigawatts of solar energy was produced that year.</p>
          <h1 style="color: rgba(16, 16, 18, 0.861);"> 7. If two pieces of the same type of metal touch in space, they will bond and be permanently stuck together</h1>
          <img src="https://discovery.sndimg.com/content/dam/images/discovery/fullset/2021/5/13/CoverPhoto_Hubble_MilkyWay_img1_0.png.rend.hgtvcom.406.406.suffix/1620949598756.png" alt="images">
          <p style="color: #a40f0fdc;"> <br> This amazing effect is called cold welding. It happens because the atoms of the individual pieces of metal have no way of knowing that they are different pieces of metal, so the lumps join together.<br>

              This wouldn't happen on Earth because there is air and water separating the pieces. The effect has a lot of implications for spacecraft construction and the future of metal-based construction in vacuums.</p>
          
          <h1 style="color: rgba(16, 16, 18, 0.861);"> 8. The largest asteroid in our solar system is a mammoth piece of space rock named Ceres</h1>
          <img src="https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-46484852,width-200,height-150/news/science/nasas-dawn-spacecraft-reaches-dwarf-planet-ceres.jpg" alt="images">
          <p style="color: #a40f0fdc;"> <br> The asteroid — which is sometimes known as a dwarf planet — is almost 600 miles in diameter. It's by far the largest in the Asteroid Belt between Mars and Jupiter and accounts for a whole third of the belt's mass.<br> Ceres' surface area is approximately equal to the land area of India or Argentina.<br>

              The uncrewed spacecraft Dawn finished up its mission orbiting Ceres in Oct. 2018, helping us totally transform our understanding of the world.</p>
          <h1 style="color: rgba(16, 16, 18, 0.861);"> 9. One day on Venus is longer than one year on Earth</h1>
          <img src="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBajl5IiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--1771be6bd46710c30aa93cd6c3ababe23ad52681/480x320_venus.png?disposition=inline" alt="images">
          <p style="color: #a40f0fdc;"> <br> Venus has an extremely slow axis rotation that takes about 243 Earth days to complete one full cycle. Funny enough, it takes Venus even less time in Earth days in order to complete one revolution around the sun — 226 to be exact.<br>

              Furthermore, the sun rises every 117 Earth days, which means that the sun will rise only two times during each year, which is also all technically in the same day. Since Venus also rotates clockwise, the sun will rise in the west and set in the east.</p> 
          
          <h1 style="color: rgba(16, 16, 18, 0.861);"> 10. Jupiter's Red Spot is shrinking</h1>
          <img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/79/196079-050-A8735694/image-Jupiter-Great-Red-Spot-spacecraft-Juno.jpg?w=300&h=169&c=crop" alt="images">
          <p style="color: #a40f0fdc;"> <br> Jupiter's famous Red Spot has been shrinking over the past few decades.<br> This spot on the planet is a giant spinning storm that used to be able to fit about three Earths. Now, only one Earth can fit inside the spot.

              Interestingly enough, as the storm is shrinking in width, it's actually growing taller in length.<br> Scientists are still stumped as to why this phenomenon is occurring in the first place, but some theorize that it may have to do with jet streams on Jupiter that have either changed direction or location.</p>
